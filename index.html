          <p>What Is An Americano?
			The most simple answer = it's a shot of espresso topped with hot water.
 			If you're American you'll know that a Starbucks Americano comes hot or iced...
 			but whats really in that drink? and where did it come from?The story goes that 
 			when American soldiers were stationed in Italy during WWII, they balked at the strong flavor of the espresso drunk by the natives.
 			"Legend has it that when soldiers in Italy encountered espresso, they watered it down to make a concoction similar to the coffee they drank at home." - First Lt. Michael Haft and First Lt. Harrison Suarez

          Caffè latte is a coffee-based drink made primarily from espresso and steamed milk. It consists of one-third espresso, two-thirds heated milk and about 1cm of foam. Depending on the skill of the barista, the foam can be poured in such a way to create a picture.In Italy, latte means milk.What in English-speaking countries is now called a latte is shorthand for "caffelatte" or "caffellatte" ("caffè e latte").

          <p>Kishi says the flat white originated in either Australia or New Zealand (the flat white’s origin story generates fierce debate). “People there call milk drinks white coffee and non-milk drinks black coffee. So flat white means milk coffee with a tiny bit of foam on top. Like, not as foamy as a cappuccino,” explains Kishi, noting how a cappuccino is usually one-third espresso, one-third steamed milk and one-third foam.
		  A latte is espresso and steamed milk, with a little bit of foam on top. “A flat white has a little bit less foam, but it’s like a latte,” says Kishi. Flat white devotees sometimes go a little bit further when differentiating it from a latte. Some say the magic of the flat white lies in how the milk is steamed and poured (it should be free-poured, which leaves rich micro foam throughout the beverage).This makes it seem sweeter — and less milky tasting — than a latte 	(it has caramel notes) with a luxurious mouthfeel. The espresso also comes through more in a flat white.
